Hello! My name is Connor.

For the past couple of years I have taken a step back from coding, as I did not enjoy it as a career choice as much as I thought I would.
So to be honest. I'm a complete github beginner, as well as having to relearn most of the stuff I ignored in my classes.

As for what you'll find within my github, I'm not so sure. But I would like for it to be a place for me to store all my delves into 
my dumb projects and learning expereinces.
